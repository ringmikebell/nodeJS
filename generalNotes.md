node.js...

is a lightweight, flexible, very performant javaScript platform that allows JS to run on a computer or server, reducing the need to to learn multiple langauges(like php or ruby).

node has a collection of over 60,000 plug and play libraries/packages which are managed via "npm" - which, does not stand for node package manager for some reason, but plays that role.
